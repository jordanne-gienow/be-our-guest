# be-our-guest

Ma ch√®re Mademoiselle, it is with deepest pride
And greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight
And now we invite you to relax
Let us pull up a chair as the dining room proudly presents
Your dinner!
Be our guest! Be our guest!
Put our service to the test
Tie your napkin 'round your neck, cherie
And we'll provide the rest
